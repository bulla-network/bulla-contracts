# Bulla Contracts V1
The Bulla Protocol is a blockchain commerce primitive for [contigent claims](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contingent_claim). It is a simple protocol for minting credit relationships between a creditor and debtor, represented as an ERC721 token

Each claim token contains crucial metadata about the transaction and handles payments.

Not only is BullaClaim a necessary data-wrapper for ERC20 transactions, but a myriad of uses for Bulla arise after taking a closer look:
1. On-chain trial balances + PNL
2. Out-of-the-box triple entry accounting
3. Auditable and descriptive transaction histories
4. Factorization
5. P2P lending primitives
6. A data layer for off-chain credit scoring
7. Leveraging credit for illiquid commerce relationships
